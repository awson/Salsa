Building:

To build the driver assembly, run within this directory:

  csc -filealign:512 -optimize+ -out:Salsa.dll -target:library Driver.cs

Or if mono:

  mcs -filealign:512 -optimize+ -out:Salsa.dll -target:library Driver.cs

No further step are necessary. The file 'Salsa.dll' will be read and
embedded from this directory automatically when building the Salsa library.
